// Two kinds of constant live in this file, and the difference matters:
//
// TUNABLE — instance-level defaults. Every one of these has a matching
// field on RealitySplitOptions (or a Variant), so overriding it is a
// supported, safe thing to do from the outside.
//
// MEASURED — read frame-by-frame off the reference clip (a 700px square,
// the word "Reality", 162 frames at 25fps) and, further down, the
// constants of the mechanism itself: the golden-angle scatter, the
// relaxation pass, the ink-box padding, the spring, the timeline. None of
// it is exposed through the options API. The eases have fatter tails than
// any closed-form curve would give you and the seam gaps are three
// different sizes because a human made them — these are data, not taste,
// and the ones that look most arbitrary are exactly the ones that must
// not move.
